# Backend (Rust)

Minimal bootstrap service for Carnine.

## Build Dependencies

To build the gRPC code, you need to install Protocol Buffers compiler:

```bash
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
```

The protobuf schema is shared across frontend and backend at `../proto/carnine.proto`.

## Commands

- `cargo check`
- `cargo run`
- `cargo test`

## Current State

This is an initial executable skeleton. gRPC services and domain modules will be added incrementally.
